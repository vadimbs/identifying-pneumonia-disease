# Identifying pneumonia disease on chest X-rays by image-based deep learning

According to the World Health Organization Ð° child dies of pneumonia every 39 seconds. This infectious disease, claiming the lives of over 800,000 children under five every year, or around 2,200 every day.<br>
Pneumonia is consistently estimated as the single leading cause of childhood mortality, killing more children than HIV/AIDS, malaria, and measles combined. Almost all of these deaths are preventable.<br>
Model was built for prediction pediatric pneumonia on data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia" target="_blank">kaggle.com</a>.

## Conclusions

Chest X-rays present a difficult classification task due to the relatively large amount of objects, and fairly big irrelevant areas such as outside the lungs that are not used for the diagnosis of pneumonia.<br>
The resulting models shows that this neural network has the potential to learn from complicated images with a high degree of generalization using a relatively small amount of data.<br>
This transfer learning approach can be used for the diagnosis of common human diseases by creating screening programs, particularly in remote or low-resource areas, leading to improved clinical outcomes and public health.<br>
